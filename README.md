# React app with auth by rrv6 

This project is a demo for me to train my self to React JS.
You can log in, unlog and subscribe to the service.

You'll need to create a database using Firebase at : https://console.firebase.google.com.
Once you've created this one. 
Complete an ".env" file into the project repository with the data Firebase give you to log your project.
